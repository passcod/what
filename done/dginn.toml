what = "A personal finance tool for the budgetless."
how = "Adandoned or indefinitely delayed. Or, rather, a finance/budgetting tool for me, who absolutely doesn’t work with budgets or comprehensive ledgers or putting my household into Xero or anything like that. I’ve tried. I’ve failed. I don’t really need a tool that will track things on a day to day basis, and I don’t need a tool to help me save. But I do need a tool that understands personal finance: incomes, expenses, tax; costs that are always the same on some kind of schedule, costs that are within a range on average, one-off purchases, etc. I’m interested in knowing how much I’m putting away every month, quarter, year; in seeing how much the model differs from the reality; and in having a bird’s eye view of everything I gain and spend, normalised and denormalised, graphed, smoothed, and averaged, to be used as a tool to make informed decisions about the future. In the end, this is what I’m trying for: a tool to empower."
