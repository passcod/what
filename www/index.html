      <h3 class="how">How I’m doing that / Some details:</h3>
      <p>The idea so far is to track both what I want to read, what I’m reading, following, etc, all with a minimal amount of interactions. Simply visiting a fanfic page should track it, and some work with the Intersection Observer API should yield a pretty accurate detection of actively reading a fic vs just having it open or looking through it without really&nbsp;reading.</p>

      <h3 class="how">How I’m doing that / Some details:</h3>
      <p>This is both about this frustration with not having reasons for following, or blocking, or not following, or muting, etc... accounts on Twitter, and a challenge to design and write a service with the most amount of encryption while still being able to offer something that works. Really, the philosophy is that I don’t want to be able, as an admin operator, to read any of the reasons, or any of the people affected by the reasons, or even if possible, the social media usernames of the people using the service, at least not without some willful modifications to the service, or a trace on the process, something like that. Someone obtaining an entire copy of the database should not be able to determine anything beyond the number of users, and the number of reasons. Someone otaining that plus either the source or the binary of the service should also have that same amount of access. That means layering and chaining, and careful design thought, especially as putting all user data in one encrypted blob is not going to work efficiently with potentially tens or hundred of thousands of reasons per. Making data queryable without looking inside is an interesting&nbsp;challenge.</p>

It has the potential to be fairly funny even if I’m being a downer and writing super-sad character development up front (because Percy was a child during the wizarding war, and that can’t have been all fucking sunny days and happy&nbsp;occasions).</p>

      </header>

      <h3 class="how">How I’m doing that / Some details:</h3>
      <p>This is a suite of tools written in Rust that read tweets from either your timeline or Twitter archive zips and store them in a Postgres database. Then there’s a few other tools that can manipulate that database. There’s also “native” support for deletion of tweets. The idea is both to have a queryable archive (finding tweets using SQL is a pretty cool experience) and to be able to delete tweets based on queries without doing lots of requests to Twitter: there's just pulling the tweets, and deleting&nbsp;them.</p>

        <time class="started" datetime="2018-11-22">Started 22 November 2018</time>
        
      </header>

      <h3 class="how">How I’m doing that / Some details:</h3>
      <p>The actual deploy tool is a client/server/agent suite with some neat features but aiming to be extremely light on resources, at least compared to many other tools I’ve tried. But the core underpinning, the main idea, comes from playing around with btrfs volumes/snapshots and the export/import commands on the tool. Essentially you can ask for an export of a volume, and you can ask for an export of a volume <b>based on another volume</b>, then on import, which can be on a completely different filesystem/disk/machine, as long as you have that same base volume, you can restore. So you can have filesystem-level diff archives on demand, with no awareness from the application being built/deployed, and everything is already in standard linux tools. It just needs some wrapping and&nbsp;managing.</p>

      <p>It’s a custom Ruby bot with its own custom framework. Originally it grew from an IRC bot using the Cinch framework, but when the community moved to Discord the framework got adapted, and then refactored. The bot has a low key sassy attitude, provides a bunch of common small tools (like dice, random pickers and choosers, writing prompts, etc), but also has a pretty good “wordwar” implementation, and its prized jewel: a name generator seeded from some 150 000 actual names from various&nbsp;sources.</p>
