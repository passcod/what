what = "A deploy tool / experiment using Btrfs volume archives."
how = "The actual deploy tool is a client/server/agent suite with some neat features but aiming to be extremely light on resources, at least compared to many other tools Iâ€™ve tried. But the core underpinning, the main idea, comes from playing around with btrfs volumes/snapshots and the export/import commands on the tool. Essentially you can ask for an export of a volume, and you can ask for an export of a volume <b>based on another volume</b>, then on import, which can be on a completely different filesystem/disk/machine, as long as you have that same base volume, you can restore. So you can have filesystem-level diff archives on demand, with no awareness from the application being built/deployed, and everything is already in standard linux tools. It just needs some wrapping and managing."
